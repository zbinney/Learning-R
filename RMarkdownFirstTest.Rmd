This may or may not be an English sentence. You decide. We report.

```{r}
##Toyline code
  #Create some data for a simple scatterplot with trend line
  a <- 2
  b <- -3
  sig_sq <- 2.0
  x <- runif(40)
  y <- a + b * x + rnorm(40, sd = sqrt(sig_sq))
  avg_x <- mean(x)
  
  
  #Print the two 40-observation objects you just created
  x
  y
  
  #Print the mean of X to a .txt file
  write(avg_x, "avg_x.txt")
  
  #Create a scatterplot with trendline of X and Y
  plot(x, y)
  abline(a, b, col = "purple")
  
  #Print scatterplot to external PDF file
  dev.print(pdf, "toy_line_plot.pdf")
